WEEK ONE: Getting Started with Web Development
Hello everyone! 👋
 We’re thrilled to have you start your web development journey with us. This week is all about laying the foundations—understanding the basics, setting up your tools, and preparing for the exciting weeks ahead.

1. Basics of Web Development
Start by reading through the [Basics of Web Development]("Week 1/Basics of Web Development.md") section in the main guide. Focus on understanding:
How the internet works 🌐


What frontend and backend mean


Role of HTML, CSS, JavaScript


💡 Tip: Don’t just read — code along and experiment in your editor.
2. Practice by Building
Try making a simple webpage (e.g., a personal profile).


Show it to your peers.


Review and improve based on feedback.


👥 Code reviews are a great way to grow. Learn from others, and help them too.
3. Version Control (Git & GitHub)
Learn the basics of version control:
Creating local repositories


Making commits


Pushing to GitHub


This will help you manage your code better and collaborate with others.
Start here:
Install Git


Create a GitHub account


Try making your first repository!
4. React Setup (Very Important 🚨)
By the end of this week, ensure that you have:
Installed Node.js and npm


Set up React


We’ll dive into React in Week 2, so get this out of the way now to avoid delays later.
6. Assignment
At the end of the week, complete the Week 1 Assignment. It will test your understanding of:
HTML/CSS basics


Javascript


Version control commands


React setup


Submit it before the deadline 🕒
7. Extra Practice (Optional)
Feeling motivated?
 Download the Practice Folder for more hands-on tasks.
How to Download:
Go to the practice folder link.

Open it in Visual Studio Code.


Then just start editing the files to match the goal.png inside each folder!
