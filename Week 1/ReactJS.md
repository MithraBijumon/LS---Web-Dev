<h1>LS DEV (React.js)</h1>

Welcome back to Week 2 of our course on Web Development with React.js! Now that you've set up React and are familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's time to go deeper. This week, we’ll focus on understanding the key concepts of React—components, props, state, and hooks—and begin building real-world applications.
Our goal is to help you confidently create interactive, responsive, and reusable UI components using React.
So, let’s dive in!



⚛️ React vs HTML – Can You Spot a Difference?
HTML is a markup language used to structure static content on the web, while React is a JavaScript library designed to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. HTML offers a linear and static structure, whereas React uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build reusable UI pieces that can be maintained efficiently. While HTML alone can't handle interactivity or state changes, React can manage application state and user events with ease. Additionally, React leverages a virtual DOM to make updates efficient by only re-rendering parts of the UI that change, unlike HTML which reloads the whole page. React also supports one-way data binding, which makes applications more predictable and easier to debug.



🚀 Which is Faster: React or HTML?
React is generally faster than traditional HTML in dynamic environments, thanks to its use of the virtual DOM. The virtual DOM updates only the parts of the webpage that need changing, rather than refreshing the entire page. This results in better performance and smoother user experiences.



🧠 Introduction to React.js
React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It allows developers to break down the UI into reusable components, manage internal application states, and render views dynamically based on those states.
React simplifies building modern front-end apps by efficiently updating and rendering the right components as your data changes.
