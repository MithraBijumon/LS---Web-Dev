## **Project 1: Task Tracker App**

### **Project Statement:**

**Build a simple Task Tracker (To-Do List) web app using React.\
** The application should allow users to add, complete, delete, and
filter tasks. This project helps practice React fundamentals such as
components, state management, event handling, and conditional rendering.

### **Learning Outcomes:**

-   Understand React component structure

-   Manage state using *useState*

-   Handle form inputs and events

-   Conditionally render UI elements

-   Dynamically render lists using *.map()*

### **Requirements:**

1.  **Add Task:\
    > **

    -   An input field and a button to add a new task.

2.  **Display Tasks:\
    > **

    -   Show tasks in a list format with:

        -   Task name

        -   Checkbox or button to mark as completed

        -   Button to delete a task

3.  **Task Filters:\
    > **

    -   Buttons to filter tasks: All, Active, Completed

4.  **Basic Styling:\
    > **

    -   Use CSS or inline styles to make the app visually clean.

### **Bonus (Optional):**

1.  **Add Due Dates & Priority Levels:\
    > **

-   Allow users to assign a **due date** and a **priority tag** (High,
    > Medium, Low) to each task.

-   Sort tasks dynamically from **highest to lowest priority**, and
    > optionally group or highlight tasks nearing their deadline.

2.  **Smart Completed Task Handling:\
    > **

-   When a task is marked as completed:

    -   Apply a **strikethrough and fade effect** (reduced opacity or
        > transparent text)

    -   Automatically **move it to the bottom** of the task list for
        > better visibility of pending tasks.

3.  **Integrated Task Timer:\
    > **

-   Enable users to set a **countdown timer** for individual tasks.

-   Useful for focus-based productivity techniques like the **Pomodoro
    > Method**.

-   Optionally show a "Time Remaining" indicator next to each task and
    > trigger an alert when time is up.

4.  **Dark Mode Toggle:\
    > **

-   Provide a simple toggle to switch between **Light and Dark themes**.

-   Improves accessibility and allows users to work comfortably in
    > different lighting environments.
