# CSS Frameworks

By now, you’ve covered the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and you’ve installed **React JS**. But before jumping into React, let’s first explore **external CSS frameworks**.

> **Why?**  
Because frameworks like **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS** help you build modern, responsive layouts **faster** and **more efficiently**. You’ll be amazed by how much time you save once you start using them!

## Why Use a CSS Framework?

Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature                    | Traditional CSS | Bootstrap / Tailwind |
|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Time to build layouts      |   Longer       |   Much faster        |
| Responsiveness             | Manual media queries | Prebuilt responsive utilities |
| Code readability           | OK             | Clean, modular classes |
| Reusability                | Limited        | Highly reusable |

## Let’s Start with **Bootstrap**

### What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a **free**, open-source framework that includes prebuilt **CSS** and **JavaScript** components like:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Navbars
- Grids
- Alerts
- Modals

It saves you from writing repetitive styles and helps you build **responsive websites quickly**.

### Setting Up Bootstrap

#### Use the CDN (Recommended)

No need to download anything! Just include the Bootstrap CDN link in your HTML:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Tailwind CSS (Completely Optional)
-------------------------------------

Tailwind is another modern CSS framework. Unlike Bootstrap, it doesn’t come with ready-made UI components. Instead, it provides **utility classes** that you can mix and match to build any layout.
