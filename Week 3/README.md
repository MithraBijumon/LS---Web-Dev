# WEEK 3 â€” Backend Begins!

Hey everyone! 
Hope you're all doing great and excited to begin **Week 3** of *Full Stack Pro: Frontend to Backend* by **WnCC**.

This week, weâ€™re entering the **Backend world** â€” where your apps become truly dynamic and powerful!

## Whatâ€™s in Store This Week?

### Python Basics
If you're new to Python or want a refresher, make sure to go through the [**Python Basics**](./Basics%20of%20Python.md) section in the content. It covers everything youâ€™ll need to comfortably get started with backend frameworks.

> You can also brush through the core web dev concepts [**here**](./Core%20Web%20Dev%20Concepts.md)

### Why Backend?
Frontend lets users *see and interact*, but backend brings apps to life â€” **handling data, logic, authentication, and more.**  
You'll be introduced to backend this week. But before that let's delve into why it's important [**here**](Why%20Backend%3F.md).

### Django: The Main Framework
Weâ€™ll be using Django, a powerful Python web framework, to build the backend. Go through [**this**]() doument to make yourselves comfortable with django.

---

### Practice Folder
Weâ€™ve added a **Practice Folder** this week to help you get hands-on with Python backend exercises.  
You can clone the repo, run the examples, and try modifying them for better understanding.

> Donâ€™t skip this â€” backend makes more sense when you actually build and break things yourself!

---

## Assignment

The **Week 3 Assignment** is now live and focuses entirely on **backend concepts** â€” like handling data.

> This is a **crucial part** of your final project. In Week 4, youâ€™ll combine this backend with your frontend to create a full-stack app.
